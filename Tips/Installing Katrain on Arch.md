If you're having trouble installing Katrain from the AUR package, you can install it using pipx instead. Here's how:

1. Install *python-pipx*

```
sudo pacman -S python-pipx
```

2. Install Katrain through pipx

```
pipx install katrain
```

To integrate Katrain as a desktop application:

1. Create a .desktop file for Katrain in `/usr/share/applications/` with the following content:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Katrain
GenericName=SGF Editor (Go)
Comment=A tool for analyzing games and playing go with AI feedback from KataGo.
Exec=/home/pauluke/.local/bin/katrain
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=/usr/share/icons/katrain.png
Categories=Game;
MimeType=application/x-go-sgf;
```
Ensure you have the Katrain icon in /usr/share/icons/ with the correct name, e.g., katrain.png.

Obs.: After installation, you might need to configure the engine (KataGo) within the Katrain interface.
