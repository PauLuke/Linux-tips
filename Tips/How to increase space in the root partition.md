# How to increase space in the root partition

## Download the bootable GParted Live image and install it on a USB flash drive:

1. Download the [GParted Live image](https://gparted.org/) iso file in the oficial site.

2. You can follow the [installation instructions](https://gparted.org/liveusb.php) or direct install [UNetbootin](https://unetbootin.github.io/) to create the bootable pendrive. Obs.: you can try to install UNetbootin through AUR, but I always used the official site.

3. Follow the instructions inside UNebootin. Your pendive must be formatted in FAT, otherwise it will not work.

4. After boot in Gparted fron the pendrive, you should decrease the space of the patition that follows '/' (may be '/home'?) from the left.
