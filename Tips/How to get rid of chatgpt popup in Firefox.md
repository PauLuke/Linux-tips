When accessing ChatGPT via Firefox I always had that annoying popup asking: "Allow chatgpt.com to store data in persistent storage?"

How to solve that?

You can disable it by clicking the lock icon in url bar -> Connection secure -> More infomation -> Permissions -> Store data in persistent storage
