# Increasing zoom in *nemo*

I recently switched from *nautilus* to *nemo*. I noticed that the default icon size in Nemo was too small on my screen, so here’s how I increased it:

## 1. Change the default zoom level

Go to **Edit > Preferences > Views > Default zoom level**.
  
Nemo supports different view modes (Icon View, List View, Compact View), and you can set a custom zoom level for each according to your needs.

## 2. Refresh *nemo*

To apply the changes, press **F5** to refresh the window.
  
**Note:** If you manually change the zoom level for a specific folder, Nemo will remember that custom setting and won’t apply the default zoom level to it.
