# Emojis and Asian fonts on Arch

Emojis and Asian fonts are not included by default in Arch Linux, so you'll need to install some packages to enable support.

To display Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, you can install `noto-fonts-cjk`, which includes both Noto Sans CJK and Noto Serif CJK.

For emojis, you'll need at least one supported emoji font installed. I usually install two packages: `noto-fonts-emoji` and `ttf-font-awesome`. I've observed many projects utilizing icons from Nerd Font, so I recommend installing `ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols` as well.
